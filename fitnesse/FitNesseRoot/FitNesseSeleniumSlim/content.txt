FitNesse Selenium fixture in [[slim format][http://www.fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM]]. Resembles [[Xebium][http://xebia.github.io/Xebium/]], but it's even more similar to [[Selenium IDE Firefox Plugin][http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/]]. Also gets inspiration from [[hsac-fitnesse-fixtures][https://github.com/fhoeben/hsac-fitnesse-fixtures]] but doesn't try to "simplify" Selenium IDE development flow. This project is licensed under [[MIT][https://github.com/mpobjects/fitnesse-selenium-slim/blob/master/LICENSE]].
